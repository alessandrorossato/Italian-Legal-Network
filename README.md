# Italian Legal Network Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to build a comprehensive network of relationships among Italian laws by leveraging web scraping on the Brocardi website, a repository of Italian legal texts. By extracting and organizing relevant data, this project seeks to establish connections between different legal provisions. 

## Objectives
- Extract data from the Brocardi website to map the relationships among Italian legal articles.
- Construct a network of these relationships to analyze the interconnectedness of legal provisions.
- Provide centrality measures for the full network, highlighting key articles and their importance.
- Allow for detailed exploration of specific books or relationships between different books within the legal corpus.
- Enable the analysis of smaller sub-networks due to the computational power required for the full network.

## Key Features
- **Data Extraction**: Web scraping to collect data on Italian laws from the Brocardi website.
- **Network Construction**: Creation of a comprehensive network representing the relationships among various legal provisions.
- **Centrality Measures**: Calculation of centrality measures for the network to identify important legal articles.
